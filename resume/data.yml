  description: Blip is a pure technological hub responsible to build all of the major applications for Paddy Power Betfair,
               one of the biggest betting companies in the world.
               I've been developing a lot of Android applications and libraries for the entire group always with high code standards
               with scalability and readability in mind.
               Lately, brought kotlin multiplatform to the table and since then I've been building one of the core layers of our applications 
               in a way that it could be shared among other platforms as well.
               The projects I'm dealing with at blip allowed me to polish my skills in the following areas - 
               Android, Java, Kotlin, Gradle, MVP, MVVM, Jetpack, DI..

  description: A multi-cloud platform and file manager that allowed to seamlessly deal with all the files(local and cloud) 
                with a built-in docx and gdoc collaborative editor made in-house.
                I was responsible to build the Android app, unfortunately the startup no longer exists, which means that the app 
                can't be found in the play store anymore. Part of our tech stack was bought by Dropbox.
                During the development of this app I faced a lot of challenges related to build a file manager targeting a wide range
                of Android versions and some devices from weird manufacturers with unexpected behaviours.
                Also spent a lot of time thinking and designing effecient ways to sync clouds with endless files and folders, as well as thinking 
                about caching mechanisms.

knowledge: I've been playing with Android since 2010 but "only" in 2014 I've started to deep dive into it professionally.
          In 2017 I fell in love with Kotlin, started to advocate it inside the company and in the GDGPorto local community by giving some talks.
          In the last year I've been also using it to share business logic across multiple platforms.
          I'm curious by nature, so I've been keeping an eye into flutter as well and already used it in some company internal applications.

contributions:
- name: Kotlin for Java Developers
  description: Although I had some experience with kotlin when this course was announced at KotlinKonf 2018
                I took it anyway. It's a great course from Jetbrains that helped me consolidate my knowledge.
