  description: Blip is a pure techonological hub reponsible to build all of the major applications for Paddy Power Betfair,
               one of the biggest betting companies in the world. I'm currently the Android tech lead and 
               I'm responsible for the three major Android apps(PaddyPower Sports, Betfair Sports and Betfair Exchange). 
               I'm also the major contributer and the gate keeper of most of the shared libraries we have within other 
               Android applications that are being built in UK and Romania technological hubs of the group. 
               I've been also internaly advocating the use of Kotlin native to share business logic between other platforms we target. 
               The projects I'm dealing with at blip allowed me to polish my skills in the following areas - 
               Android, Java, Kotlin, Gradle, MVP, MVVM, Jetpack..

- company: TOPDOX
  position: Android Engineer
  timeperiod: 2015 - 2016
  description: A multi-cloud platform and file manager that allowed to seamlessly deal with all the files(local and cloud) 
                with a built-in docx and gdoc collaborative editor made in-house.
                I was responsible to build the Android app, unfortunately the startup no longer exists which means that the app 
                can't be found in the play store anymore. Some of our tech stack was bought by Dropbox.
                During the development of this app I faced a lot of challenges related with building a file manager targeting a wide range
                of Android versions and some devices from weird manufactors with broken journeys.
                Also spent a lot of time improving things related with syncing clouds with endless files and folders, as well as thinking 
                about caching mechanisms.

knowledge: I've been playing with Android since 2010 but "only" in 2014 I've started to deep dive into it.
          In 2017 I fell in love with Kotlin, started to advocate it inside the company by giving some inductions and internal talks.
          In the last year I've been also using it to share business logic across multiple platforms.
          I'm curious by nature so I've been keeping an eye into flutter aswell, I feel I'm becoming proficient at it without much investment 
          which seems to be the point of flutter after all (mostly using it for internal company apps).

                but I took it anyway. It's a great course from Jetbrains that helped me consolidate my knowledge.
